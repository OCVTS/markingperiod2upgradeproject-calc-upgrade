            <h2>project description</h2>
            <p>
                My project is a calculator that allows you to input numbers and do math equations. How it works is you press any number you want and it will input into the Calculator
                and do the equation you put in. My project has operators like +, -, /, √, X, =, and a clr.   
            </p>
            <h2>project process</h2>
            <p>
                The process of the calculator project was copying the code that I had already and then researching more information for I can add more into my calculator.
                A few problems I ran into is making the new operators that I have in my code to work. It took a while to figure out how each operator can function correctly.
                The new operators I will adding into my calc is √,x2,%, and greater than or less than.
